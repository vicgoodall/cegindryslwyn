# Cegin Dryslwyn Restaurant
## Introduction
Cegin Dryslwyn is a small independent restaurant at the foot of Dryslwyn Castle in a small valley in West Wales. Instead of a set menu, the business has gained attention by only using the best of local produce, changing its menu sometimes daily and committing to only using local ingredients.

The website enables customers to make bookings, obtain contact details and find out more about the restaurantâ€™s ethos. The target audience are considered to be time-poor, mainly browsing on their phones, and might want to make a booking quickly during the day while they are out of the house. Thus the site is designed with mobile users as its priority.

The deployed website can be found HERE.

### Strategy

* Make a reservation within two minutes

* Check location & opening hours quickly

03. As the customer, I want to check the opening times so that I know when I can have dinner/ call the restaurant.

### Look and Feel

The colour palette for this project is predominantly dark greens and blues with a bisque font colour to contrast. This is to reflect the verdant setting of the restaurant.
The emphasis is placed on the picturesque location and the food itself, therefore a focus is placed on photography. The user is initially presented with the background images, which have been selected for their dramatic effect.

### Typography
Text boxes are thus kept with a minimalist style that makes them both easily legible and to prevent overwhelm on the page overall. 
"Open Sans' was selected from Google fonts for this reason, with sans-serif as backup should this fail to export.
